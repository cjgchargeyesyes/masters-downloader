# masters-downloader
This is a roblox audio downloader, designed to successfully install roblox audios with ease, with only the restriction of finding the place-id of the sounds.
Im planning to add a clothing downloader, and possibly even more features in the future. This is a small project I made for my friend masterbaiter23 (dont mind the name). He owns a leaking server, and he asked if I could make this for him.

Required things to run the downloader:
1. Ran the setup.bat file which will download the neccessary python imports  (this is important if you dont have it installed)

2. Downloaded python so that the executable can run. Download Python 3.8 or higher from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   
=====================================================================

Now, to download audios, you firstly need to locate the place id of the game where the audio originates from. Example;
if your game is roblox.com/games/123456/gamename is where your sound id came from,
123456 will be the place id. Universe id is not required for this.

You cannot use your own game's place id, many people get confused on this. You can only use the place id of where the sound was published.

To download the audios, you can just use option number 2, and insert your sound ids using 123, 123, 123 format.

Thank you for using masters downloader! -banger and masterbaiter23
